Combination of map-based navigation and search capabilities.

The aim is for a visitor in the area to find their way to any location within the client’s designated geo-fencing area. User’s location is used to serve as origination point of a route to any chosen location within the geo-fenced area. If the user is outside of the the geo-fenced area, route information is still available with map zoom reduced.
Details and a map route of any location is found by using:

1. Predictive search text field.
2. List of locations from categories such as “Amenities” or “Entertainment”.
3. Directions button added from any listed “Events”.

Fulfilling requirements for the client is achieved by providing maintenance capabilities of their solution’s content, together with access to usage and performance data of their solution.
To this end, the solution will be divided into two main parts: App and Client. App is the software downloaded by a member of the public from Google Play or Apple’s app store. It is intended that the App is used on Android and iOS mobile operating systems. Client is a web browser interface with administrator privileges which includes data governance and usage reporting capabilities.
